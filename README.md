# XML-nobelPrizes

This project was developed during my university studies in the "Advanced XML Technologies" course. It provides an exploration of XML data processing using the Oxygen XML Editor, focusing on Nobel Prize data.

## Project Overview

The project involves working with a provided Nobel Prize database, utilizing pagination for data reading. Nine tasks were designed to meet various requirements, demonstrating proficiency in XML technologies.

## Repository Contents

- **XQuery Files**: Scripts for querying and manipulating XML data.
  - `ex1.xquery`
  - `ex2.xquery`
  - `ex3.xquery`
  - `ex4.xquery`
  - `ex5.xquery`
  - `ex6.xquery`
  - `ex7.xquery`
  - `ex8.xquery`
  - `ex9.xquery`
  - `ex10.xquery`

- **XML Schema Definitions (XSD)**: Schemas defining the structure of XML data.
  - `ex2.xsd`
  - `ex3.xsd`
  - `ex4.xsd`
  - `ex8.xsd`

- **HTML Output**: Generated HTML file from the XML data.
  - `ex10.html`

- **README.md**: Project description and overview.

## Getting Started

To explore and run the scripts in this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OcsenasBence/XML-nobelPrizes.git
   cd XML-nobelPrizes
   ```

2. **Ensure Oxygen XML Editor is Installed**:
   The project utilizes the Oxygen XML Editor for processing. You can download it from [oxygenxml.com](https://www.oxygenxml.com/).

3. **Open and Run XQuery Scripts**:
   Load the `.xquery` files in Oxygen XML Editor to execute the queries and view the results.
